When producing a large number of plots (visualizing individual series, diagnostics, etc) each plot gets saved separately. I am using the pdf format and when all plots are done, I manually combine them into a single pdf where I can scroll through the plots. It would be convenient if the plot function would allow plots to be combined into a single pdf.

LAGS ARE LIMITED TO +/-99 LAGS: IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO BEYOND THAT? FOR EXAMPLE 120 LAGS CORRESPOND TO 10 YEARS OF MONTHLY DATA, 30 YEARS OF QUARTERLY DATA. LONGER LAGS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR CALCULATING GROWTH OVER THE GIVEN PERIOD.
